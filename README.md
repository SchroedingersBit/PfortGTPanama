# PfortGT World Final Panama 2023 ðŸ¤–

## Introduction
This is the GitHub repository for the autonomous driving car of the **PfortGT Team** of the **Landesschule Pforta from Germany** for the **WRO Future Engineers World Final 2023 in Panama**.
In this repository we go into our planning - and building process for our car. We describe our problems and ideas we had along the way and explain our construction plans and programs.
## Overview
Our car is powered by an Arduino. It consists of a chassis which is equipped with individually 3D-printed mounts for the various sensors and the camera (see [components](/vehicle/components)). Power is supplied by a rechargeable battery (see [electronics](/vehicle/electronics)). The sensor equipment consists of three ultrasonic sensors, a gyro sensor and a Pixy Cam2 (see [sensors](/vehicle/sensors)). For the opening race, an Arduino code processes the distance to the walls measured by the ultrasonic sensors to make small steering adjustments to the car (see [Opening Race](/programming/Opening Race)). In the obstacle race, in addition to the ultrasonic sensor code, a camera script is also used (see [Obstacle Race](/programming/Addvance Race)). This looks for red and green color signatures via the Pixy Cam and keeps them on the screen section (right or left) corresponding to the respective turn of the car.
## Structure
Our repository is divided into several subgroups in which each topic of focus is discussed.
### Development
In [development](/development) we describe our development path. We describe the ideas we had during the process, the problems we faced and how we solved them.
### Programming
In [programming](/programming) we explain the heart of this competition, the coding. We describe and explain our structure, the decision for C++ and the two focal points [Opening Race](programming/Opening Race) and [Obstacle Race](programming/Obstacle Race), as well as our actual [Overall Program](Programming/Overall Race).
### Vehicle
In [vehicle](/vehicle/) it is shown in detail how our car is built. The [components](/vehicle/components) of the car are shown, how they are assembled and which of them were bought or 3D-printed. In [electronics](/vehicle/electronics), our electronic wiring is explained and how the power supply for the motors and sensors is regulated is discussed. Besides that we discuss the hardware the car is equipped with and what made us decide to do this. Furthermore, our used [sensors](/vehicle/sensors) 
are explained, what the special features are and why we decided to use them. Additionally, [3D printing](/vehicle/3D printing) lists our files and work for our printed parts.
### Pictures
In [pictures](/pictures) there are photos of the car from different angles as well as our team photo. 
### Performance videos
In [videos](/videos) Youtube links are deposited, which demonstrate the performance of our car in test tracks for the various tasks.
### Quellen
In [sources](/sources) we document our sources of information. In addition, all [purchases](/sources/purchases) we have made for the additional components and the installation paths with the associated setup instructions for the software we use are stored.
