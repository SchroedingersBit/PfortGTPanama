# Development

First, the chassis was planned. It was important to keep the turning radius as small as possible and therefore the car short. So the following first sketch was made:

Now the steering had to be considered. The standard solution is an Ackermann steering mechanism, which quickly causes the rear axle of the car to break away if the dimensions are incorrect. We developed a graphical calculation system using GeoGebra (which can be found )On the other hand, the rack and pinion steering is more difficult to build. After trying to 3D-print different steering mechanisms, we decided 
In the end, due to time constraints, we first modified the finished chassis with the given electronics and steering. We then printed more and more parts and were able to replace most of the parts with ours and also add additional components, such as the camera tower, which later had to be moved to the rear to ensure a better view. After further improvements we replaced the base plates with our own.

A crucial change is also the exchange of the two gears, so that instead of a large to small transmission, there is a small to large transmission. Therefore, the car drives slower, but has a greater torque and does not stop at low speeds, thus overcoming greater static friction forces / rolling friction forces.
