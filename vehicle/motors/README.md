## Servo motor

We tried to make our robot as small as possible so that our rotation radius is small. This enables us to maneuver faster on curves and to avoid blocks better. For steering we use a servo motor which can rotate $60Â°$ to the right and to the left. We use Ackermann steering to translate the rotation of the servo motor to the wheels. Even though the Ackermann steering is not optimal, it is sufficient for our purposes. The servo motor has a standstill torque of about $4.3 \frac{kg}{cm}$, which we take off at a distance of about 3cm. This allows the servo to apply a force of about $14N$. Our robot has a mass of no more than $1kg$ and the friction coefficient can be no more than $1$, which makes a friction force of about $10N$. So our robot would be able to overcome this situation.
## DC-Brushless motor
Another important consideration is the DC brushless motor. With the DC motor we have the possibility to drive forward and backward, which does not exclude possible solutions of the challenges. Also, with this drive motor, we have no risk of connecting it incorrectly, as it is independent of this. We made a gear ratio of about 1 to 2 for torque amplification and at the expense of speed.
